Time-management is a digital version of Growth Book with additional features being incorporated into Xnk project (self version of Kolak by Gilles Castel). Growth Book is a term coined by John Fish, a Harvard Student, to prepare a to-do like list with time blocking feature. Deep Work and Shallow Work is the concept by Cal Newport to distinguish the work types and get the work done with the limited willpower.

Initial version: Initially, I adopted the already created 'timetrap' from GitHub, which actually uses the Time-Blocking feature, and can create number of sheets--thus, allowing to separate Deep Work and Shallow Work, but again this somehow is not the Growth Book style. Thus, I find it quite difficult as it not being intuitive and easily customize-able like paper version of Growth Book.

New Version: I am creating it on my own because this thing into single application does not exist, and patching the work of different project would make the system bloating and difficult to maintain. I am creating its mind-map(requirements specification) here. Once all mind-map is done, I will create easily executable steps. Initially, I planned to create it as a utility that can be functioned through terminal, but later I realized this can well done as a Web-application and can be integrated inside Kolak. This servers much better approach and easy for me to maintain too, and all things at one would also be achieved.

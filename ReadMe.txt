This text file documents the plan for the project. It can also be used to document the progress if needed, else it is self-explanatory.

Xnk Project is developed in motivation from Gilles Castel's Kolak Project. It is a place for everything, which I dream since I was in class 11. Thus, making this is not only useful but also fulfilling my childhood's wish. One in All is defined as the center workplace of the computer. It will primarily consist of :

A. Time-Management System
Time-Management, which in itself can be considered independent is combined to Xnk application. The project is designed to manage time effectively with aim of increasing productivity, inspired by Growth Book technique.

B. Access to everyday used tools
Includes Calendar with events handling, To-do (embedded with Growth Book), Habit Tracker, and custom Home Menu which is combination of mini-system. 


To-Dos:
0. Downloading font or using other alternatives to font.
0.1 rsync between this folder and from Apache
1. 3 months default entry to ">>" so that I have to write less in updating growth book. Do in Cron-job
2. The above task also helps to make default entries for specified tasks. Thus, preliminary automation of growth book works.
3. A task adder for the specific day and time, so that it is also shown in Growth Book, only possible once the above two things work.
4. A side calendar to jump on that day of the growth book.
5. Work Type is not functional now as expected.
6. Sleep Time graph is not showing correct data
7. Make CSS compatible with phone and tablet
8. Get a proper name, title and logo for the webpage
9. Online and Offline Database synced
10. Sync among all devices
